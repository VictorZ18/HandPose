This project uses a hand-pose detection from Tensorflow, as well as the fingerpose extension. 
It's goal is to recognize the ASL(American Sign Language) alphabet.
 
This is a REACT app.
This is my first time using REACT for a project.

First step is initialize NPM with:

npm install

To laucnh installation of the packages run:

npm i 

This will install everything needed.


To run the app:

npm start 

You should then be able to enjoy the ASL alphabet recognition machine.
The tracking can be a bit off, some letters will be misinterpreted.
